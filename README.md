### 2. Understanding Spatial Bayesian Statistics

#### What is Spatial Bayesian Statistics?

Spatial Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with modelling and analyzing data that has a spatial or geographic component. It allows researchers to account for spatial dependencies and patterns in their data. Spatial Bayesian models use Bayesian estimation techniques to make probabilistic inferences about spatial relationships.

#### Why Use Bayesian Methods for Spatial Analysis?

Bayesian methods are particularly well-suited for spatial analysis because they provide a flexible framework for modelling complex relationships and incorporating prior information. Some advantages of using Bayesian methods for spatial analysis include:

- Ability to handle uncertainty: Bayesian methods allow you to quantify and propagate uncertainty through your analysis.
- Integration of prior knowledge: You can incorporate prior information into your models, which is especially useful when dealing with limited data.
- Flexibility: Bayesian models can be adapted to various types of spatial data and research questions.

### 3. Data Preparation

#### Data Sources

The tutorial materials provided are based on the Indian Periodic Labour Force Survey for the years 2017/8 and 2018/9. These datasets are open access and can be obtained from the following website: [Indian Periodic Labour Force Survey](https://mospi.gov.in/web/mospi/download-tables-data/-/reports/view/templateOne/29001?q=TBDCAT) (accessed July 2022).

The website provides tabular data, and you may need to use a dictionary to code the labels onto the data.

#### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis. The tutorial materials include full code for cleaning the Indian data to prepare it for spatial Bayesian analysis. This code can serve as a reference for cleaning data for other aspects of Indian society or different research questions.

### 4. Spatial Regression with Bayesian Estimation

#### Introduction to STAN

STAN is a probabilistic programming language that is commonly used for Bayesian analysis. In the tutorial materials, you will find examples of spatial regression models implemented in STAN. You will learn how to write and run Bayesian models for spatial analysis using STAN.

#### Spatial Models

Spatial regression models allow you to investigate how spatial relationships affect the variables of interest. These models can be used to analyze spatial patterns, identify clusters, and make predictions while accounting for spatial dependencies.

### 5. Hands-on Tutorial

#### Running Spatial Bayesian Models

The tutorial materials include code, figures, and datasets related to labour force participation in India for specific age groups. You will learn how to run Bayesian spatial regression models using this data. The tutorial guide provides answers to set tasks, helping you understand the practical implementation of these models.

#### Interpreting Results

Interpreting the results of Bayesian spatial models is a crucial step. You will learn how to interpret the output of your models, including posterior distributions, credible intervals, and spatial effects. Understanding these results is essential for drawing meaningful conclusions from your analysis.
